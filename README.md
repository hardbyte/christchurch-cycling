Quick script to scrape the Christchurch City Council cycling
data from https://smartview.ccc.govt.nz/map/layers/ecocounter



Ideas:

- Python script to get the data and make available as a CSV/parquet file. 
- Run nightly (GCP Build Job, Cloud Task)
- Metabase Dashboard (Add people who care as Admin)
